1. Window resizing does not work.

    12/5/98 - Window sizing fully supported, except for auto font scaling.
        Sizes stored in Gambler.INI file.

2. The program is not listed in the Window List

    12/5/98 - Corrected

3. The program allows the player to ante on a hand which
   cannot be covered.

    12/5/98 - Corrected

4. The "Advice" button uses a simplistic algorithm.

5. There are no sound effects.

6. Payout is not animated.

7. The jackpot does not grow.

    12/5/98 - Jackpot grows about 2 cents per second.  Last jackpot
        saved in Gambler.INI file.  Jackpot now has upper and lower limits.

    12/6/98 - The jackpot may not be growing quickly enough.

    12/11/98 - Jackpot now grows 10 cents per "tick".

8. The progressive payout is as yet untested.

    12/5/98 - Progressive payout seems to work.

9. The accelerators do not function.

    12/5/98 - Accelerators implemented.

10. An exit button should be added.

    12/5/98 - Done

11. The code should be internationalized.

12. A new game specific icon should be created.

    12/11/98 - Done

13. Parameters should be loaded/saved via INI file.

    12/5/98 - Code is in place.  New values need only be added when needed.

14. The deck library, Standard.DLL, does not load on certain computers.

    12/6/98 - A diagnostic window has been added, but probably won't tell
         much.  It might be the raw size of the DLL, or the mix of 16 and 256
        color bitmaps.

    2/2/99 - This was found to be a compilation which depended upon the
        VisualAge C++ libraries.  It has been corrected.

15. The statistics cannot be viewed.

    12/11/98 - Fixed.

16. A "cash out" button should be added, and recorded statistically.

    12/11/98 - Done.

17. On a 640x480 system, the subwindows are too small.  Button text is
    unreadable.

    12/11/98 - Buttons have been enlarged, need to test

18. Help has not been implemented.

    2/2/99 - Done, but needs improvement.

19. On Todd's system, closing the statistics screen crashes the program
    at $108C7 (which is line 218 in the Resize routine).  The assembler
    instruction is FSTP QWORD PTR[ESP].  It has not been observed on
    any other machines, nor from field tests.

20. Card back selection should be implemented.

21. The DLL loading should consider specifying the exact source directory.
    This will prevent future problems with systems which have multiple
    common DLL names.

22. The game is unaware of failures to load Standard.DLL.

23. The fonts should be scaled.
