Issues with Blackjack, March 29th, 1999

1. Split does not force a resize to show the cards

    3/29/99 - Corrected

2. Sounds have not been implemented

    3/29/99 - Sounds have been added.  Might add individually selectable
    sounds, including announcement of hand values.

3. The bet circle does not use chips yet

4. The bet circle does not refresh correctly when the active hand
   changes

5. Help has not yet been implemented

6. Split hands do not pay out correctly.

    3/29/99 - Corrected

7. The positioning of cards becomes corrupted during additional
   dealing.

   3/25/99 - This has been found to be a bug/feature of GpiWCBitBlt, 
             whereby the target coordinates are altered by the function
             call under some drivers.  Fixed by copying the target
             location to temporary storage for the call.

8. The "advice" button has not been implemented.

9. The background is simply green instead of a table bitmap.

10. Insurance is offered unconditionally when an ace is shown.

11. Doubling does not change the value in the bet circle.

    3/29/99 - Corrected.

12. The dealer's cards are space too far apart and could overwrite
    the shoe if more than about 6 cards are dealt.

13. The shoe does not show the marker.

14. The "settings" dialog does not center itself

15. The "settings" dialog treats "Hit soft 17" and "Double 10/11 only"
    as the same setting.

    3/29/99 - Corrected.

16. The window sizing is not saved/restored.

    3/29/99 - Corrected

19. The Sound On/Off menu does not function.

    3/29/99 - Corrected, although it might be replaced by a sounds dialog.

20. Payout animation should be improved.

21. There is no restriction on playing after splitting aces.

    3/29/99 - Corrected

22. After playing a split hand, the window does not resize
    for single hand play.

    3/29/99 - Corrected.

23. An option to allow players to continue playing on split aces should
    be implemented.
