Issues remaining with MultiPoker Base - March 25th, 1999

1. Name of game does not appear.  Should put in titlebar

    Corrected 7/30/98

2. Value of initial hand should be indicated on payout table, and in smaller
   text above cards.

    1/26/99 - Initial value is displayed above cards, but in full size text.

3. It should not be possible to select a different card game after the first
   set of cards has been dealt, but before the final set.

   Corrected 7/30/98

4. A provision for nagware restrictions must be made.

   2/7/99 - It has been decided that the OS/2 version will be freeware.

5. Appearance of dealt cards should be animated.  Perhaps speed adjustable.

6. The opening window should not show "nothing" as a hand value.

    Corrected 7/30/98.

7. Upon opening, the game should be ready to play, without needing to get
   money, or select a game.  Perhaps money and game selections should be saved.

    7/30/98 - The "new" function is executed automatically upon invocation.
    2/7/99 - Users have requested an automatic game selection.

8. The current bet should be shown during play.

    2/7/99 - This will probably be done in the payout field.

9. The advice system needs to be implemented, and disabled if the selected
   game does not offer advice.

    8/4/98 - Implemented.

10. Hotkeys should be assigned to all major functions, including discarding.

    7/30/98 - F5-F9 are used for discard, + for bet, spacebar for bet 5.
    8/14/98 - "A" for advice, "O" for odds, and "D" for deal have been added.

11. Sounds should be added, as an option.

12. The standard deck should be redrawn.

    8/14/98 - Done.

13. Deuces Wild requires a special deck where the deuces indicate "wild".

    8/14/98 - Done.

14. There should be a provision for the same game using different payouts.

    1/26/99 - Will implement as DLLs, not as options.

15. Each game type should preserve its last hand, so that when it is switched
    to, the displayed cards are redrawn.

    1/26/99 - Instead, new games will display card backs.

16. Fonts used within the game should be scaled to window size.

    2/7/99 - User feedback has complained about font sizes, especially
    in the payout table.

17. The game DLLs need to implement their respective odds calculations.

    8/4/98 - Implemented.  Odds calculation accuracy under test.

18. Version number information should be automated and available.

    7/30/98 - Version shows on titlebar, but does not update automatically.

19. Window parameters need to be saved to Gambler.INI file.

    1/26/99 - Done.  Window size and maximize/minimize flags saved.

20. Some form of help should be implemented.

    2/7/99 - Done.  Game specific help has not been implemented yet.

21. A game specific icon should be created.

    1/26/99 - Done.

22. An install program should be created.

    2/7/99 - The Compulsive Gambler's Toolkit has an installation program.

23. Some form of statistics recording should be done.

24. The card backs should be implemented.

    1/26/99 - Done.

25. It is possible, however unlikely, that a blank card appears.

    1/26/99 - This is believed to be caused by the random number
    generator, which can (although rarely), generate 1, which
    creates a card number equal to 53 in a 52 card deck.  When 1 is
    generated, the randomizer is called again.

26. The "About..." dialog should be implemented.

    1/26/99 - Done.

27. The DLL loading and selection should be restricted to the game
    directory.

28. The payout table should be converted to standard text.  This makes
    it more readable at a given font size, and allows colored marking
    for bet and payout information.

29. More game DLLs should be written

30. Might consider having any deck except Standard.DLL only provide cards
    which differ from Standard.DLL.  This would reduce the size of similar
    decks (such as DWDeck.DLL) considerably.

31. Should consider increasing the resolution of the decks.

32. Decks with multiple backs should allow user selection.

33. The money should be handled as in Caribbean Stud, whereby the money
    can be cashed out, added, and recorded. (ie. replace "New" with
    "Add $25").
